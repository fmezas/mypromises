## Synopsis

Implementation of the Promises/A+ specification

## Code Example

You know, the usual:

```javascript
var Promise = require('mypromises');

var f, r;
var p = new Promise(function(onFulfill, onReject) {
  f = onFulfill;
  r = onReject;
});

// fulfill with the solution
f(42);
// or reject
// r('boom!');

// and so on...
// p.then(...);
```

## Motivation

This is just a naive implementation I wrote to make sure I fully understood the [Promises/A+ spec](https://promisesaplus.com/). If you are like me and had trouble following all the promise resolution cases in your head while reading the spec, then examining the code of this implementation might help you.

I've tried to give code clarity priority over any other consideration:

- pure functions except where side effects are expected per the spec (resolving Promise's)
- objects (Promise's) mostly just contain data

My next step is to optimize for performance. Comments are welcome.
