## Synopsis

Implementation of the Promises/A+ specification

## Code Example

You know, the usual:

```javascript
var Promise = require('mypromises');

var p = new Promise(function(onFulfill, onReject) { /* do something with onFulfill and/or onReject here */ });
```

## Motivation

This is just a naive implementation I made to fully understand the Promises/A+ spec

## Installation

```
npm install mypromises
```

## Tests

```
npm run-script node
```
